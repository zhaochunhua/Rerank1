Brief Introduction
===================
1. This is Liu Yang's implementation for Gibbs Sampling of LDA. The test data set is Newsgroup-18828, which is included in the project. You can test other data sets with it. Just import the project into Eclipse and run LdaGibbsSampling.java to start it without any configuration. The original documents and sample output files have been included.

3. This is a initial implementation for the Topic Expertise Model which is proposed in the following paper:

    Liu Yang, Minghui Qiu, Swapna  Gottipati, Feida Zhu, Jing Jiang, Huiping Sun and Zhong Chen. CQARank: Jointly Model Topics and Expertise in Community Question Answering. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2013).  (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2505720)

    If you use this model implementation, please cite this paper.

4. We will also release more open source code for topic models in https://github.com/yangliuy.
